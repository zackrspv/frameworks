# Mentorship: Dealing with Frustrating Clients and Vendors
*How I coach people to stay sane and still get results.*

Clients and vendors will test your patience. Some drag their feet. Some overpromise and underdeliver. Some just don’t listen. You can’t control them, but you can control how you respond.

When I mentor someone through this, I remind them: focus on outcomes, not emotions. Getting mad doesn’t close the ticket, it doesn’t move the contract, and it doesn’t change the vendor’s roadmap. What does work is clarity. Set expectations in writing. Lock down timelines. Hold people accountable without turning it into a screaming match.

If the client or vendor still doesn’t deliver, escalate early. Don’t wait until the whole project is burning. And document everything. If you ever have to pull the plug, you’ll have the receipts to prove you tried.

Frustration is normal, but letting frustration drive your actions is a rookie mistake. Professionals stay steady, hold the line, and get the outcome.

## Lessons
- Write it down. Verbal promises mean nothing.  
- Hold people accountable without losing your cool.  
- If escalation is needed, do it early and with receipts.  
- Anger burns time. Outcomes pay bills.
