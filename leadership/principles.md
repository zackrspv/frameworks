# Leadership Principles
*Direct, pragmatic, no-BS leadership.*

## 🧭 Core Lines
- *“Perfect is the enemy of best.”*  
- *“Leaders don’t know better, they judge better.”*  
- *“Adoption is a systems problem, not a people problem.”*  
- *“Dashboards should drive decisions, not updates.”*  
- *“Complexity is the enemy of scale.”*  

## 💡 Notes
These aren’t motivational posters — they’re the lines I actually use in boardrooms, consulting sessions, and team standups. Simple enough to remember, sharp enough to cut through noise.
