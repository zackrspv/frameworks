# Leadership Principles
*What I expect from myself and others when leading.*

1. **Clarity over noise** – If people don’t know what matters this week, you failed as a leader.  
2. **Decisions beat perfection** – Waiting for the “perfect” plan is just a slow way to fail. Decide, move, adjust.  
3. **Own the outcome** – If your team fails, it’s your failure. If they succeed, it’s their success.  
4. **Judge, don’t micromanage** – You’re not in the trenches anymore. Your role is to judge better, not to know better.  
5. **Model the behavior** – Teams copy what they see. If you panic, they panic. If you stay calm, they stay calm.  
6. **Kill vanity metrics** – Don’t waste people’s time with numbers that don’t drive decisions.  
7. **Adoption before expansion** – If nobody is using the tool you already bought, you don’t get to buy the next one.  
8. **Simplify everything** – Complexity is the silent killer of adoption, budgets, and morale.  

Leadership isn’t about being the smartest person in the room. It’s about being the one who clears the fog so the team can move.
