# Mentorship Style
*Curiosity over condescension.*

I often get asked about how to identify when someone lacks knowledge in a particular area - for instance, if they pronounce SQL as S.Q.L. Does this indicate their proficiency in the language? This scenario is common, observed from recruiters to executives and consultants. While understanding industry terminology is crucial, penalizing individuals for using different terms is narrow-minded.

Why? Because it diminishes knowledge and the essence of human learning. Many successful developers and industry leaders are self-taught, acquiring skills through self-paced learning. They absorb knowledge by doing, sometimes supplementing it with formal education. Criticizing them for not knowing a specific industry term undermines their achievements.

So, the next time you feel compelled to correct someone, remember not to condescend while offering guidance. Instead, inquire "why" and maintain a human-centric approach. 

Seeing the HUMAN is far more imporant than being 'right' all the time.
