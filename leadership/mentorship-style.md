# Mentorship Style
*Curiosity over condescension.*

People love to nitpick. I’ve seen recruiters, execs, and even consultants judge someone’s ability because they pronounce SQL as S.Q.L. instead of “sequel.” Does that really tell you how good they are? No. It just tells you they learned differently.

A lot of the best developers and leaders I’ve worked with were self-taught. They learned by doing, they tested everything themselves, and they picked up knowledge outside the classroom. Correcting someone’s pronunciation or jargon doesn’t measure their ability. It just shows you care more about being “right” than being useful.

So when you mentor, don’t condescend. Ask why. Be curious. See how they think. Help them grow instead of slapping them for not knowing a piece of trivia.

## Lessons
- Skill is about results, not jargon.  
- Curiosity builds better teams than condescension ever will.  
- See the human first. Always.
