# Leadership by Modeling Behavior
*Leadership isn’t about lecturing — it’s about showing.*

So, as it’d been a busy day at the office, I came home and sat at the desk, just to jot some thoughts down. You know, as you do. 

My daughter, wonderful kid, sometimes a bit…more pragmatic that she should be at her age, asks me, “Dad, how can I stop someone from yelling at me when they are all up in my face?”.

As a dad, my first instinct is protective. Why is someone yelling at my daughter? Gimmie a broom, I’ll fix it! Then I thought for a moment, as much as I love my daughter she can be…frustrating…sometimes; so, maybe the yelling match was deserved. I shook that thought out, nah, she’s smart enough not to antagonize without reason.

So here I am, in my head, ignoring my daughters question, while she’s looking at me waiting for an answer, tapping her foot impatiently.

I wonder to myself, why is she being impatient? Is something really bothering her THAT much? After all, I had no notes from school, she had no new bruises, cuts or anything to worry about that I can see. So all seems fine. Maybe she got in a fight with a friend at school. That’s possible. Kids can be so rude sometimes.

At this point, she’s getting a bit frustrated, as she’s starting to pace now, ranting that I’m not paying attention and is getting a little red in the face.

I stare at her, worried she may have some high blood pressure building. Not good for the heart, no matter the age. After all, no matter what issue she’s having she really should watch how she responds to people. Can’t have that young heart get used to beating that fast all the time.

Upset now she turns on me and gets in my face yelling that I don’t care what she had to say and that she doesn’t even know why she even bothers. 

I stand up, slowly, and calmy look at her in the eyes and let her just continue to rant. She’s in full on angry teenager now: arms in the air, about a foot from my face and just going full tilt into rage. Interestingly, she has that little eye vein thing her grandma had; fascinating how genetics work, right?

After what seemed like a natural pause, I spoke. And, the utter look of confusion and shock on her face was just brilliant to behold. She stood there, incapable of a response.

Still mad.  
Still red.  
Still shaking her fist and slowly pacing.  

But, importantly, not yelling.

So I speak again, and this time ask her how she felt about what I said.

Redness fades, she sits down, and just sighs. At that point, I pat her on thr shoulder and she sighs again, utterly defeated. She gets up, I give her a hug and she goes back to her room to play the piano.

Stressful? Yes. But, hey, raising a teenager isn’t supposed to be easy.

In the end, leadership isn’t about giving the answer all the time, or giving flat advice hoping it’ll stick. It’s about modeling the behavior you want, and showing others that you can lead without being overbearing or a know it all.

So, what do you think I said to her? And how do you think I said it? Do you think she learned?
