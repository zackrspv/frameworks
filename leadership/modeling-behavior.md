# Leadership by Modeling Behavior
*Leadership isn’t about talking. It’s about showing.*

One night after work my daughter asked me, “Dad, how do I stop someone from yelling at me when they’re all up in my face?” My first reaction was protective. Who’s yelling at my kid? I’ll grab a broom and sort it out. But then I realized the better lesson wasn’t about fighting back. It was about how to respond.

She got frustrated with me at first, thinking I wasn’t listening. She started pacing, ranting, getting red in the face. Eventually she was right in my space, yelling like an angry teenager does. I stayed calm, let her vent, and waited for the pause. When she finally stopped, I just looked her in the eye, stayed steady, and asked her how she felt about what I said.

That stopped the yelling cold. She sat down, sighed, and deflated. A hug later, she was back at the piano. The fight was over before it really began.

The point isn’t about parenting. It’s the same in leadership. People don’t learn from lectures or long speeches. They learn from what you model. If you stay calm under fire, your team learns to stay calm under fire. If you react with rage, so will they.

## Lessons
- Leadership is modeling the behavior you want to see.  
- Staying calm under pressure teaches more than a lecture ever will.  
- People remember how you respond more than what you say.
