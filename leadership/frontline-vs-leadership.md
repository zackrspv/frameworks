# Leaders Are Not Front-Line Workers
*Stay out of the trenches. That’s not your job anymore.*

Leaders love to “roll up their sleeves” and jump back into the weeds. It feels good. It feels productive. But here’s the problem: if you’re always in the trenches, nobody’s leading.

Your job isn’t to fix tickets or close deals. Your job is to make the trenches safer, clearer, and more sustainable for the people who are actually there every day. That means listening to front-line supervisors and workers and making their feedback count. It means aligning systems so they can work without friction. It means protecting their time instead of piling on more.

The moment you think you “know better” than the people doing the work, you’re lost. You don’t know better. You only have the vantage point to judge better. That’s your role.

## Lessons
- Leaders set conditions, workers fight the battles. Don’t confuse the two.  
- If you’re constantly firefighting, you’re not leading.  
- Respect your front line. They see things you don’t.
