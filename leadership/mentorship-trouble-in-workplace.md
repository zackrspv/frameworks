# Mentorship: Handling Trouble in the Workplace
*Conflict happens. What matters is how you show up.*

Workplace trouble comes in a lot of flavors. Personality clashes. Missed deadlines. Politics. Even outright incompetence. My approach is simple: don’t let it fester, don’t let it derail the mission, and don’t let it drag you into the mud.

When I coach someone on handling this, I tell them to separate signal from noise. Is the conflict about ego, or is it about process? Is the problem really about a person, or is it about a broken system that keeps creating friction? Nine times out of ten, the system is the problem.

If it’s a people issue, deal with it directly. Don’t gossip. Don’t triangulate. Have the hard conversation, one-on-one, and focus on behaviors and outcomes, not personalities. If it’s a system issue, fix the system. Document the process, remove the blockers, and eliminate the ambiguity that fuels conflict.

And here’s the reality: not every fight is worth fighting. Sometimes you step in. Sometimes you step back. The trick is knowing the difference and teaching your team the same judgment.

## Lessons
- Don’t let conflict sit. Address it fast.  
- Fix systems first. People problems often start there.  
- Have the hard conversations directly, not in side chatter.  
- Not every battle is worth it. Pick the ones that move the mission.
