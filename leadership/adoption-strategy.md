# Adoption Strategy

## Problem
Most orgs buy tools and think adoption will magically happen. Reality check: adoption stalls at 40–50% and leadership wonders why the investment feels wasted.

## Framework
1. **Remove Friction** – Single sign-on, fewer clicks, fewer steps. If it’s painful, people won’t use it.  
2. **Align to Workflow** – Don’t force people to change how they work. Make the tool fit their flow.  
3. **Visibility** – Track usage, show adoption metrics, tie them directly to KPIs leadership already cares about.  
4. **Training** – Forget 8-hour workshops. Quick hits, cheat sheets, and micro-sessions stick better.  

## Example
At CHR, CRM adoption was stuck below 50%. By cutting complexity, aligning the system to agent workflows, and pushing micro-training, adoption jumped to 90%+. That single shift turned the CRM from a complaint box into a trusted daily tool.

## Lessons
- Adoption isn’t a “people problem.” It’s almost always a systems problem.  
- If leadership can’t see adoption rates, they’ll assume it’s fine until it’s too late.  
- Adoption sticks when tools get out of the way and just work.
