# Adoption Strategy

## ðŸš© Problem
Most orgs buy tools â†’ adoption stalls at 40â€“50%.  

## ðŸ”§ Framework
1. **Remove Friction** â€“ Simplify logins, reduce steps.  
2. **Align to Workflow** â€“ Match tool flow to how teams actually operate.  
3. **Visibility** â€“ Show execs the adoption data, tie to KPIs.  
4. **Training** â€“ Micro-trainings + cheat sheets > all-day workshops.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
This is how I drove adoption at CHR from 40% â†’ **90%+**.  

## ðŸ§­ Principle
Leaders donâ€™t know better â€” they judge better. Listen to supervisors and workers; your role is alignment and sustainability, not micromanagement.
