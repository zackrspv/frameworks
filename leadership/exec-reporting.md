# Executive Reporting That Actually Works

## Problem
Most executive dashboards are useless. Vanity charts, numbers nobody trusts, and data that doesn’t connect to outcomes. Execs stop reading them and decisions get made blind.

## Framework
- **Tie every metric to an outcome** – “Closed transactions” means something. “Clicks” does not.  
- **Keep it short** – 3 to 5 KPIs per function is enough. Anything more is noise.  
- **Assign ownership** – Every KPI must have a name attached. No name, no accountability.  
- **Set cadence** – Weekly for ops, monthly for exec reviews, quarterly for strategy.  

## Example
- Outcome: 98% ticket closure within 4 hours  
  - KPI: Average handle time  
  - Owner: IT Manager  

- Outcome: Closed transactions up 12% in 2 months  
  - KPI: Number of closed deals  
  - Owner: Sales Director  

## Lessons
- If no one owns the metric, it will rot.  
- Dashboards are only valuable if they drive actual decisions.  
- Stop reporting for the sake of reporting. Report what changes the business.
