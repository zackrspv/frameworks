# Executive Reporting That Actually Works

## 🚩 The Problem
Most exec dashboards are vanity metrics — charts nobody reads, data nobody trusts.

## 🔧 Framework
- **Tie every metric to an outcome** – “Closed Transactions” not “Clicks.”  
- **Less is more** – 3–5 KPIs per function.  
- **Owner-driven** – each KPI has a named owner.  
- **Cadence** – weekly for ops, monthly for execs, quarterly for strategy.  

## 📈 Example
- Outcome: “98% ticket closure within 4 hours.”  
  - KPI: Avg handle time.  
  - Owner: IT Manager.  
- Outcome: “Closed transactions up 12% in 2 months.”  
  - KPI: # closed deals.  
  - Owner: Sales Director.  

## 💡 Lessons
- If no one’s name is on it, it’s not a KPI.  
- Dashboards are only useful if they drive **decisions**, not updates.
