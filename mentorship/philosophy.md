# Mentorship Philosophy
*Grow leaders, not followers.*

## 🚩 The Problem
Too many leaders hoard knowledge, creating dependency instead of capability. Real mentorship flips that.

## 🔧 Approach
- **Curiosity First** – Ask why, not “did you do it right.”  
- **Hands-On Pairing** – Sit in, commit code, review side-by-side.  
- **Feedback Loops** – Regular, candid feedback > annual reviews.  
- **Promote Autonomy** – Give people space to solve, step in only when blocked.  

## 💡 Lessons
- Good mentors make themselves obsolete.  
- Mentorship is judged by how many leaders you create, not how many people rely on you.
