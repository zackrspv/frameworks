# My Leadership Philosophy
*How I see leadership after 25+ years across military, enterprise, and startups.*

Leadership isn’t about titles or how many people report to you. It’s about outcomes. Did the system get better because you were there? Did people leave stronger, more capable, and more confident than when they started? If not, what’s the point.

I’ve been in enough roles to know this: hype, tools, and jargon don’t matter. Adoption, execution, and judgment do. I don’t chase shiny objects. I cut through noise, I simplify systems, and I focus on ROI. That’s how you scale an org without wasting money or burning people out.

I also don’t buy into the myth that leaders must always “know better.” That’s arrogance. Front-line people know the details better than I ever will. My job is to judge better — to weigh tradeoffs, to clear roadblocks, to make the calls nobody else wants to make.

And when it comes to people, I believe in mentorship through respect and curiosity. You don’t build strong teams by talking down to people. You build them by modeling the behavior you want to see, asking the right questions, and giving them the room to own their work.

## Core Beliefs
- Leadership is measured in outcomes, not titles.  
- Simplicity beats complexity every time.  
- Judge better, don’t pretend to know better.  
- Model first, talk second.  
- Respect the human before you critique the skill.
