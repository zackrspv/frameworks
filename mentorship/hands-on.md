# Hands-On Mentorship
*Coaching by rolling up my sleeves when it matters.*

I don’t believe in sitting in an ivory tower giving abstract advice. If I mentor someone, I’m in the mix with them. Not to take over their work, but to show them how to approach the problem, how to break it down, and how to think differently about it.

Hands-on doesn’t mean micromanaging. It means reviewing their code and explaining *why* I would change something. It means walking through a tough decision and pointing out the tradeoffs. It means taking a messy process and fixing it side by side, so they see how to simplify it next time.

Mentorship is about building judgment. The goal isn’t to make people dependent on me. The goal is to show them a way to think so they can handle the next challenge without me standing there.

## Lessons
- Mentorship is coaching in context, not theory.  
- Do the work with them once, so they can do it themselves the next ten times.  
- Your value as a mentor is in building independent thinkers, not clones of yourself.
