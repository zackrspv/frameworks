# Hands-On Mentorship
*Ship together, learn together.*

## 📂 My Style
- **Clarification Commits** – I’ll fix edge cases, adjust code for clarity, but I explain *why*.  
- **Code Reviews as Coaching** – It’s not red pen, it’s growth time.  
- **Pragmatism > Perfection** – Shipping matters more than academic purity.  

## 📈 Example
Most of my commits in private repos are not flashy features — they’re “clarification commits” that help teams understand, unblock, and keep shipping at scale.  

## 💡 Lessons
- Mentorship is not a Slack message, it’s in the trenches.  
- Great code reviews are leadership in disguise.
