# Frameworks by Phillip Rumple

*Playbooks for digital transformation, AI adoption, leadership, and operational excellence.*

## 🎯 Purpose

After 25+ years spanning USAF comms, enterprise consulting, startups, and AI infrastructure, I’ve built repeatable frameworks that cut through SaaS sprawl, fix adoption bottlenecks, and right-size technology.

This repo isn’t about code — it’s about **how I think, lead, and execute**.
Most of my hands-on commits live in private org repos.
Here, you’ll find the **roadmaps, templates, and playbooks** I use to drive results.

## 🛠 How To Use

These frameworks are **modular**.
You can drop one into an SMB, a mid-market org, or a scaleup without reinventing the wheel.

I’ve used them to:

* Reduce IT budgets by 42–70%
* Boost adoption (40% → 90%+)
* Scale AI clusters for real-time inference
* Build reporting that execs actually read
* Mentor teams into leaders that scale themselves
