# Frameworks by Phillip Rumple

*Playbooks for digital transformation, AI adoption, leadership, and operational excellence.*

## 🎯 Purpose

I’ve spent 25+ years in USAF comms, enterprise consulting, startups, and AI infrastructure. Along the way I’ve built and battle-tested frameworks that cut through SaaS sprawl, fix adoption bottlenecks, and right-size technology.

This repo isn’t about code. It’s about how I think, lead, and execute.  
Most of my commits live in private org repos.  
Here, you’ll find the roadmaps, templates, and playbooks I use to deliver results.

## 🛠 How To Use

These frameworks are modular. You can drop one into an SMB, a mid-market org, or a scaleup without reinventing the wheel.

I’ve used them to:
- Reduce IT budgets by 42–70%  
- Boost adoption from 40% to 90%+  
- Scale GPU clusters for real-time inference  
- Build reporting execs actually use  
- Mentor teams into leaders who scale themselves
