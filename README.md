# Frameworks by Phillip Rumple
*Playbooks for digital transformation, AI adoption, and operational excellence.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose
After 25+ years spanning USAF comms, enterprise consulting, startups, and AI infrastructure, I’ve built repeatable frameworks that cut through SaaS sprawl, fix adoption bottlenecks, and right-size technology.  

This repo isn’t about code — it’s about **how I think, lead, and execute**.  
Most of my hands-on commits live in private org repos.  
Here, you’ll find the **roadmaps, templates, and playbooks** I use to drive results.

## 🛠 How To Use
These frameworks are **modular**.  
You can drop one into an SMB, a mid-market org, or a scaleup without reinventing the wheel.  
I’ve used them to:
- Reduce IT budgets by 42–70%  
- Boost adoption (40% → 90%+)  
- Scale AI clusters for real-time inference  
- Build reporting that execs actually read
