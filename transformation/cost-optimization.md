# Cost Optimization Framework

## Context

Most orgs overspend on IT because no one questions the invoice. SaaS sprawl, overlapping vendors, and “it’s only $20 per user” thinking add up fast.

## Steps

1. **Audit** – List every tool, license, contract.
2. **Cut** – Eliminate duplicates, kill “nice-to-haves” no one uses.
3. **Consolidate** – Find platforms that cover multiple needs without bloating.
4. **Renegotiate** – Vendors expect you not to push back. Prove them wrong.
5. **Measure** – Track actual adoption and real spend over time.

## Example

At CHR we cut 42% of IT spend in under six months without losing capability. In fact, adoption went up because we simplified.

## Principle

Cost optimization isn’t about slashing budgets. It’s about killing waste so you can reinvest in growth.
