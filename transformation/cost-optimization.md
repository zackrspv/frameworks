# Cost Optimization Framework
*Cutting costs is not about slashing. It’s about right-sizing.*

Most orgs bleed money because nobody checks what tools, vendors, or infra are actually being used. Shadow SaaS, bloated clouds, duplicated subscriptions. Then leadership wonders why IT spend is climbing every quarter.

When I optimize costs, I don’t just cut. I stabilize, simplify, and right-size. That way costs go down, but performance and adoption actually go up.

## How I Approach Cost Optimization
1. Audit every tool and vendor. If you can’t show usage, it’s gone.  
2. Kill duplicates. If three tools do the same thing, you only need one.  
3. Renegotiate contracts. Vendors drop prices when you call them on it.  
4. Right-size infra. Don’t run 64-core instances if your load sits at 20%.  
5. Shift workloads smartly. Cloud, on-prem, hybrid — depends on cost and control.  
6. Automate the reporting. You need real-time spend visibility, not end-of-quarter surprises.  
7. Validate with users. If cutting a tool kills productivity, rethink it.  
8. Lock it in. Document, assign owners, set review cycles.  

## Example
At Colorado Home Realty, tech spend was bloated with overlapping platforms and oversized infra. After auditing everything and consolidating, we cut costs by 42% while adoption hit 90%+. Agents trusted the tools, leadership finally had clear reporting, and infra ran leaner and more secure.

## Lessons
- Cut noise first, not muscle.  
- Vendors will always take advantage if you let them.  
- Cost optimization is not one and done. It’s a quarterly discipline.
