# Cost Optimization Framework
*Cutting costs without cutting capability.*

## 🚩 The Problem
Most orgs let SaaS sprawl eat their budgets alive. Everyone swipes the company card for “must-have” tools, infra is oversized, and nobody audits renewals. Result? Bloated spend, low adoption, and leadership shocked at end-of-year bills.

## 🔧 Framework
1. **Audit Everything** – List every subscription, license, and cloud service.  
2. **Consolidate** – Merge overlapping tools into one platform where possible.  
3. **Right-Size Infra** – Match servers and clusters to actual usage, not wishful thinking.  
4. **Negotiate Vendors** – Never accept sticker price. Renegotiate terms, bundle services, or move providers.  
5. **Cut Redundancy** – If nobody can explain why a tool matters → kill it.  

## 📈 Example
At CHR, infra had grown bloated across AWS + DigitalOcean + random SaaS. By auditing every platform, consolidating into a right-sized multi-cloud setup, and renegotiating vendor contracts, I drove a **42% reduction in tech spend** while improving stability and security.

## 💡 Lessons
- SaaS waste is invisible until you dig.  
- Cost cutting ≠ capability cutting — done right, it actually boosts performance.  
- Always tie savings back to **adoption + outcomes** or you’ll just repeat the cycle.
