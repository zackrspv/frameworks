# Digital Transformation Roadmap

## 5 Phases

1. **Immediate Fixes** – Knock down the biggest blockers and get a quick win on the board.
2. **Audit** – Inventory every tool, workflow, contract, and risk. If you don’t know what you have, you can’t fix it.
3. **Mapping** – Lay out what stays, what goes, and how you’ll consolidate.
4. **Execution** – Roll out changes in waves, lock in SOPs, train your people.
5. **Measurement** – Track adoption, cost savings, and performance in the real world.

**Note:** Stop chasing the “perfect tool.” Pick what fits your stage right now and build a plan to mature later.

## My Take

Simplify before you optimize. Most adoption failures aren’t because people are lazy or resistant. They’re because your systems are a mess.
