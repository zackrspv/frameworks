# Digital Transformation Roadmap

## 🔑 5 Phases
1. **Immediate Fixes** – Remove blockers and show early wins.  
2. **Audit** – Inventory tools, workflows, costs, and security risks.  
3. **Mapping** – Define consolidation and migration strategies.  
4. **Execution** – Implement in waves, document SOPs, train teams.  
5. **Measurement** – Track adoption, cost, and performance.  

## 🧭 Notes
- Always start with **simplification** before optimization.  
- Adoption isn’t a people problem — it’s usually a **systems problem**.
