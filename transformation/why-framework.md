# The “Why” Framework

*Always start with why before you solve what.*

In business, the “why” behind a request is just as important as the request itself. Too many companies throw money at solutions without understanding the reason.

A good BA or PO earns their keep by digging into the why. Is the issue really a missing feature, or is it a training gap? Do you need new software, or can an extension get it done?

## How to Run It

1. Ask the people with the pain points. Check helpdesk tickets, talk to frontline, talk to leadership. Don’t ignore feedback.
2. Write the goals down. Be specific about what you want fixed.
3. For each goal, ask why. Is it about efficiency? Revenue? Compliance? Or just “nice to have”?
4. Check if training, customization, or extensions can solve it.
5. Talk to the SMEs. Don’t forget your own power users.
6. Document the goals you can’t fix internally.
7. Prioritize based on business impact and user impact.
8. Build the action plan or hire a consultant with this groundwork in hand.

## Principle

Skipping “why” makes you burn money on the wrong “what.”
