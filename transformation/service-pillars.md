# Service Pillars

These are the consistent pillars I use in consulting:

1. **Adoption & Enablement** – Align tools with how people actually work.  
2. **Automation & Efficiency** – Kill duplicate work before adding bots.  
3. **Cost & Scale** – Right-size infra, renegotiate vendors, cut waste.  
4. **Security & Governance** – Compliance frameworks without killing agility.  
5. **Reporting & Visibility** – Dashboards tied to decisions, not vanity metrics.
