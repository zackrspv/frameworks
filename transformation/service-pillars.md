# Service Pillars
These are the pillars I use on every engagement. They’re not theory. They’re what actually drives adoption, lowers cost, and stabilizes systems. If a project doesn’t hit these, it’s noise.

## 1. Adoption & Enablement
If people don’t use it, it doesn’t matter. Adoption is not a “people problem,” it’s a systems problem. Tools fail when they’re bolted on without thinking about how teams actually work. My focus:
- Simplify logins, cut extra steps, reduce friction
- Align workflows so the tool supports the job, not the other way around
- Train in micro-sessions and cheat sheets, not all-day death-by-PowerPoint
- Track usage and show leadership where adoption is climbing or tanking

## 2. Automation & Efficiency
Don’t automate junk. Fix the workflow first. Then use automation to cut repeatable work and handoffs that eat time.
- Kill duplicate tasks before writing a single script
- Use scripting for small wins (a 5-line script saves more than a SaaS subscription)
- Bring in AI where human judgment is needed (classification, summarization, triage)
- Every automation needs a doc, owner, and rollback plan

## 3. Cost & Scale
Most orgs pay for things they don’t use. Cost control isn’t about slashing, it’s about right-sizing.
- Audit every tool and vendor, quarterly
- Kill duplicates and renegotiate contracts
- Scale infra step by step; don’t buy H100s when an A6000 gets it done
- Shift workloads smartly across cloud, on-prem, or hybrid depending on ROI

## 4. Security & Governance
Security doesn’t mean red tape. It means protecting the business without strangling it.
- MFA and identity controls everywhere, no exceptions
- Role-based access; least privilege first
- Compliance frameworks (SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.) baked into workflows, not bolted on after
- Incident response that actually works: stop the bleed first, fix root cause second

## 5. Reporting & Visibility
Dashboards are worthless unless they drive decisions. If nobody looks at them, they failed.
- Tie metrics directly to business outcomes
- Less is more: 3–5 KPIs per function
- Each KPI has a clear owner who can be held accountable
- Cadence matters: weekly for ops, monthly for execs, quarterly for strategy
- Reports should cut through vanity metrics and show leaders what they need to act

## Lessons
- Tools are useless without adoption
- Automation without cleanup is waste on autopilot
- Costs spiral unless you lock in a review cycle
- Security is only real if people follow it
- Dashboards need owners and outcomes or they’re just wallpaper
