# Service Pillars

These are the pillars I use every single time I walk into a company:

1. **Adoption & Enablement** – Tools only work if they line up with how people actually get their job done.
2. **Automation & Efficiency** – Don’t automate busy work until you’ve killed the duplicate work.
3. **Cost & Scale** – Cut waste, right-size infra, renegotiate vendors. Scale comes after.
4. **Security & Governance** – Protect the business without suffocating it with process.
5. **Reporting & Visibility** – Dashboards only matter if they drive decisions, not vanity slides.
