# Tool Selection Framework
*"Perfect is the enemy of best."*

Execs: The PERFECT tool doesn’t exist.

If you’re asking your Directors, Managers, PM/PO/PDs to come to you with the perfect tool to solve XYZ problem, you're already off track.

Here's the reality: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PERFECT!

There’s only the right tool: and, then a plan for how it matures in your ecosystem.

Example: You are moving from SMB to MidCap, still tracking CRM + data in spreadsheets (let's face it, that's most SMB's). So, you want the “perfect CRM/ERP/HRM”. And, you task your managers to find the perfect tool to help with scale and fix operational issues, keep it simple, keep it uniform, and preferably all within one ecosystem:

- SalesForce: $35–75k+ setup cost for most SMB's
- Zoho: Master of nothing, decent for most
- Self Hosted CRM: Full ownership, limited expansion
- Bespoke CRM: $$$ millions, if you’re lucky

You shoot them all down. And then? Back to square one. So, what do you do?

Ask for the right tool for NOW. Something that fits your growth stage and doesn’t sink you:

- SalesForce Jungo: Not insane to set up, monthly model, can be extended 7 ways to Sunday
- HubSpot: Killer for Ops/Finance/Marketing, API-friendly, modular, grows with you
- GoHighLevel: Great for marketing, complicated to setup, but highly extensible
- Monday.com: Easy monthly cost, quick to expand, helps with ERP (to an extent) and operational projects

And here’s the kicker: the right tool may not even be one tool. It could be a cluster. Just remember, tool sprawl will eat your stack alive - so only adapt to what you really need right now, not what looks ideal!

One of my favorite sayings: "Perfect is the enemy of best".
