# Tool Selection Framework

*"Perfect is the enemy of best."*

Execs: the perfect tool doesn‚Äôt exist.

If you‚Äôre asking your managers to find the one magical platform that fixes all your problems, you‚Äôre already off track.

Reality check: there‚Äôs no perfect. There‚Äôs the right tool for where you are today, with a plan for how it matures in your stack.

Example: moving from SMB to mid-cap, still running CRM out of spreadsheets. You want the ‚Äúperfect CRM/ERP/HRM.‚Äù You send your managers off, they come back with Salesforce, Zoho, self-hosted, or a custom build. You shoot them all down. Back to square one.

Instead, ask for the right tool for now:

* Salesforce Jungo: not insane to set up, subscription model, can grow with you
* HubSpot: great for Ops, Finance, Marketing, API-friendly, modular
* GoHighLevel: strong for marketing, tricky setup but expandable
* Monday.com: cheap, fast to roll out, covers light ERP and projects

And sometimes, the right tool isn‚Äôt one tool. Just remember: sprawl will eat you alive. Only adapt what you need now, not what looks ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù
