# Metrics & Ops Scaling  
*You can’t scale what you don’t measure (or what you measure poorly).*

One of the things MarPhil slams into clients early is this: stabilize + measure → scale. You don’t scale until you know your baseline, your bottlenecks, and your failure points. The numbers don’t lie.

## What I Track
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)  
- Error rates, failure trends, and exception-to-normal ratios  
- Load, capacity, resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)  
- Cost per user / per transaction  
- Tool ROI metrics (how many automations actually save hours)  

## How I Use Those Metrics
1. **Bottleneck Hunting** – If a metric is pegged, you fix or re-architect.  
2. **Operational Baseline** – Know what “normal” looks like before you scale.  
3. **Trigger Points** – When CPU > 70% for X hours, scale. When error rate > Y, auto-roll back.  
4. **Cost Controls** – Don’t let scale runaway because you forgot to set thresholds.  
5. **Trend vs Spike** – Respond differently. Spike = incident. Trend = architecture problem.

## Example
In one SaaS rollout, as user count doubled, memory consumption crept up slowly. Because we monitored utilization growth early, we caught it before it crashed. We added horizontal scaling and optimized data queries. The result: continued user growth without breaking the stack or needing emergency hires.

## Lessons
- Metrics are your control panel. Ignore them, and you drive blind.  
- Alerts don’t scale — triggers do.  
- Scaling is not linear. Measure, then expand.
