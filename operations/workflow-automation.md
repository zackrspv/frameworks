# Workflow Automation
Don’t automate junk. Fix the workflow first.

A lot of companies love to brag about “automation” but all they’ve done is make broken processes run faster. That’s not automation, that’s waste on autopilot.

## How I Approach It
1. Map the process. See what’s really happening, not what people think happens.  
2. Kill steps that don’t matter. If it adds no value, delete it.  
3. Script the small stuff. A 2-line script is better than paying for another SaaS tool.  
4. Automate the repeatable handoffs. That’s where n8n, Zapier, Airflow actually help.  
5. Bring in AI only where judgment is needed — classifying, summarizing, generating. Not copy-paste work.  
6. Blueprint everything. Diagram it, document it, and assign an owner. If nobody owns it, it’s a ticking time bomb.  

## Examples
- At CHR, staff wasted hours manually exporting Compass contacts. One n8n flow fixed it in minutes.  
- At SoMee AI, scripts couldn’t cut it. We used AI for real-time transcription and moderation, because that needed interpretation, not repetition.  

## Lessons
- Don’t automate chaos. Simplify first.  
- Scripts are faster and cheaper when the problem is small.  
- AI has a place, but only when human-like judgment is required.  
- Every automation needs a doc and a rollback plan. No exceptions.
