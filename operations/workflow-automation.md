# Workflow Automation
*When to automate, when to kill, and how to blueprint it right.*

Not every workflow should be automated. Some should be deleted outright. Others are better served by a two-line script than by a $10K automation suite. My approach is about clarity: simplify, then automate what’s left, and only scale with AI when it truly adds value.

## 🚩 The Problem
Most companies treat automation like a magic wand. They pile bad processes into Zapier, Power Automate, or n8n and think “done.” All they’ve done is make broken workflows run faster.

## 🔧 My Approach
1. **Audit First** – Map the process step-by-step. Ask: does this step even need to exist?  
2. **Kill Steps** – If a step doesn’t add value, delete it. No point automating waste.  
3. **Script Before SaaS** – If one script does the job, write the script. Don’t drag in another subscription unless scale demands it.  
4. **Automate the Repetitive** – Use automation frameworks (n8n, Zapier, Airflow) for predictable, repeatable handoffs.  
5. **AI for Judgment Calls** – Use AI only where human-like interpretation is needed: classifying data, summarizing notes, generating next steps.  
6. **Blueprint It** – Every automation should leave behind a diagram and a doc: triggers, steps, error paths, and owners.  

## 📊 Example
- At CHR, we automated Compass contact exports. Before automation, 3 staff wasted hours weekly. After automation, one n8n flow pulled, cleaned, and exported records in minutes. ROI was instant.  
- At SoMee AI, we used AI for real-time moderation and transcription. Couldn’t be done with scripts alone. That’s where AI belongs: judgment, not copy-paste.  

## 🧭 Principles
- Don’t automate chaos. Fix the workflow first.  
- Automate what’s predictable. Script what’s simple. Use AI where judgment is needed.  
- Every automation must have an owner, a doc, and a rollback plan.  

## 💡 Lessons
- Automation is a tool, not the goal.  
- Blueprints prevent black-box automations that nobody understands.  
- If you can’t explain what it does in plain language, you don’t own it — it owns you.
