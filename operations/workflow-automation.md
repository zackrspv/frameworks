# Workflow Automation
*Automate when it helps, kill when it doesnâ€™t.*

## ðŸš© The Problem
Companies slap automation everywhere, but half their workflows shouldnâ€™t even exist. Automating garbage â‰  efficiency.

## ðŸ”§ Framework
- **Question Every Step** â€“ Why does this exist? Who benefits?  
- **Automate Only Stable Processes** â€“ If it changes weekly, donâ€™t automate yet.  
- **Frontline Testing** â€“ If users hate it, adoption will stall no matter how slick the automation.  
- **Error Handling First** â€“ Build rollback paths before you scale.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Example
- Compass Export: Problem wasnâ€™t automation â€” it was filtering logic. Fixing process > automating chaos.  
- DataTables in zPortal: Users hated when edits reset pagination. Solution: reflect changes instantly, sync backend quietly.  
- Tabulator Grids: MutateLink recalculation ensured adoption without overhauling workflow.  

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons
- Automate less, question more.  
- Adoption > automation.  
- The best workflow is the one thatâ€™s no longer needed.
