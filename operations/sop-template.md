# SOP Template
SOPs should be simple. If they’re 40-page binders nobody reads, they’re useless.  

A real SOP tells people why the process matters, who owns it, and what the steps are. That’s it. One page if possible. If it takes longer, link out to scripts or configs, don’t jam them in.

## Structure
**Title:** [Process Name]  
**Owner:** [Role / Team]  
**Last Updated:** [Date]  

### 1. Purpose
Why this SOP exists. What problem it prevents or what outcome it guarantees.  

### 2. Scope
Who this applies to. Teams, roles, functions.  

### 3. Steps
1. Step one  
2. Step two  
3. Step three  

Keep it tight. If people need a 20-step guide, they won’t follow it anyway.  

### 4. Exceptions
Edge cases. “Only do this if…”  

### 5. Review Cycle
Who reviews it and how often. Quarterly works.  

## Example
**Title:** Password Reset Requests  
**Owner:** IT Support Lead  
**Last Updated:** Sept 2025  

1. Verify user identity against HR system.  
2. Reset password in directory.  
3. Force MFA re-enrollment.  
4. Send confirmation email. Close ticket.  

Exceptions: C-level requires manual approval from CIO.  
Review Cycle: Quarterly by IT Security Lead.  

## Notes
- If there’s no “why,” nobody cares.  
- If there’s no owner, it will rot.  
- One page beats ten every time.
