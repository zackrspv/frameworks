# SOP Template

## 🎯 Purpose
Standard Operating Procedures don’t need to be 40-page PDFs nobody reads. A good SOP is short, actionable, and evolves.

## 📂 Template

**Title:** [Process Name]  
**Owner:** [Role]  
**Last Updated:** [Date]  

### 1. Purpose
Why this SOP exists (what problem it prevents).  

### 2. Scope
Who it applies to.  

### 3. Steps
- Step 1  
- Step 2  
- Step 3  

### 4. Exceptions
Any edge cases or “don’t do this unless…”  

### 5. Review Cycle
How often it should be updated, and by who.  

## 💡 Notes
- Keep it on a **single page** whenever possible.  
- Link out to detail (scripts, configs) rather than stuffing them in.  
- Treat SOPs as living docs — review quarterly.

## 📝 Reminder
SOPs without a “why” become ignored checklists. Always capture why the process exists.
