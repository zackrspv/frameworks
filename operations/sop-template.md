# SOP Template
*Standard Operating Procedures that people actually read.*

Too many orgs think SOPs are 40-page PDFs nobody ever looks at again. That’s why their processes keep breaking. A real SOP should be short, actionable, and alive.  

## 🎯 Purpose
- Capture the “why” — if you don’t say why it matters, people will ignore it.  
- Provide a repeatable set of steps that reduce mistakes and re-work.  
- Establish ownership so the process doesn’t rot.  

## 📂 Structure

**Title:** [Process Name]  
**Owner:** [Role / Team]  
**Last Updated:** [Date]  

### 1. Purpose
Explain why this SOP exists. What problem does it prevent? What outcome does it guarantee?  

### 2. Scope
Who this SOP applies to. (Teams, roles, or functions.)  

### 3. Steps
List out the steps. Keep it short, clear, and numbered.  

1. Step one (action, tool, or trigger)  
2. Step two (expected output)  
3. Step three (handoff or completion)  

### 4. Exceptions
Edge cases, alternate paths, or “don’t do this unless…”  

### 5. Review Cycle
How often it should be updated, and by who.

## 💡 My Notes
- Keep SOPs on a single page whenever possible.  
- Link out to scripts, configs, or screenshots — don’t jam them into the doc.  
- Review quarterly. If it’s not reviewed, assume it’s stale.  
- If there’s no **owner**, it’s not an SOP. It’s just a note.

## 📝 Example
**Title:** Password Reset Requests  
**Owner:** IT Support Lead  
**Last Updated:** Sept 2025  

1. Verify user identity against HR system.  
2. Reset password in directory service.  
3. Force MFA re-enrollment.  
4. Send confirmation email and close ticket.  

Exceptions: C-level requires manual approval from CIO.  
Review Cycle: Quarterly, by IT Security Lead.

## 🚨 Reminder
SOPs without a “why” become ignored checklists. Always capture why the process exists and who owns it.
