# Monitoring & Observability
*Ops without visibility is gambling.*

## ðŸš© The Problem
You canâ€™t fix what you canâ€™t see. Most teams ship systems without monitoring, or worse, with dashboards nobody reads. Alerts pile up until theyâ€™re ignored. By the time you notice, customers are already screaming.

## ðŸ”§ Framework
- **Monitor what matters**  
  Track uptime, latency, errors, costs. Everything else is noise until you scale.

- **Set thresholds with sense**  
  If your alerts are going off every 10 minutes, nobody listens. Alert only when action is required.

- **Centralize logs**  
  Logs are gold. Collect them, index them, and make them searchable. If logs are split across servers, you already lost.

- **Dashboards must drive action**  
  If no decision is made from a metric, delete it. Vanity graphs waste everyoneâ€™s time.

- **Review monthly**  
  Sit down once a month and ask: which alerts were useful, which were ignored, and which saved our ass? Fix the noise.

## ðŸ“ˆ Example
When we deployed new analytics infra, costs started spiking overnight. Because we had cost monitoring tied into Grafana, we spotted it within hours and killed the runaway jobs. Without that dashboard, finance wouldnâ€™t have flagged it for 30 days.

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons
Boring operations are the goal. The less fire-fighting you do, the more time you have to scale. If your monitoring is loud but useless, youâ€™re not operatingâ€”youâ€™re gambling.
