# Security Framework
*Compliance without killing agility.*

## ðŸŽ¯ Principles
- **Device Lifecycle** â€“ Company devices max 3 years old, personal devices blocked if >5 years.  
- **MDM Enrollment** â€“ All company-issued devices must be in MDM.  
- **Role-Based Access** â€“ Access tied to role, not request. Agents â‰  execs.  
- **Segregation** â€“ Personal vs company accounts never mix for PII or contracts.  
- **Rapid Reporting** â€“ Lost/stolen device = immediate report, liability if negligence.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Example
CHR IT policy rewrite:  
- Ops staff = Windows PCs.  
- Creative staff = Macs.  
- Execs + agents = company phones + MDM enforced.  
- Agents with personal devices = limited access.  

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons
- Security works when rules are simple, not 50-page PDFs.  
- Role clarity prevents both over-permissioning and bottlenecks.  
- Negligence is an operational, not technical, risk.
