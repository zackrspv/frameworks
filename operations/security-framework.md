# Security Framework
*Security isn’t paranoia. It’s insurance that you won’t get blindsided.*

I’ve run ops in real estate, finance, healthcare-adjacent projects, and AI clusters. Different industries, but the same truth: security only works if it’s practical. If it gets in the way of people doing their job, they’ll work around it — and that’s how breaches happen.

## My Security View
- **Baseline Everything** – MFA, role-based access, logging. No exceptions.  
- **Least Privilege Always** – If you don’t need access, you don’t get access. And if you need it, it’s time-boxed.  
- **Secure by Default** – Systems should be locked down first, then opened up. Not the other way around.  
- **Assume Breach** – I design as if someone already got in. Contain it fast, monitor the blast radius, and cut off lateral movement.  

## How I Troubleshoot Security
1. **Reproduce the Risk** – Don’t just read the alert. Try it yourself. Can I exploit it? If yes, so can someone else.  
2. **Trace the Entry Point** – Misconfig, weak credential, or bad code. The cause matters more than the symptom.  
3. **Patch or Contain** – Sometimes it’s a fix, sometimes it’s isolation until you can fix properly.  
4. **Review the Controls** – Why wasn’t this caught earlier? Was it people, process, or tech?  
5. **Close the Loop** – Update SOPs, retrain staff, and log the fix so it doesn’t repeat.  

## Example
On AI infra, everyone wants speed. But speed without guardrails = disaster. We had devs pushing unreviewed containers into live clusters. I enforced gated pipelines, RBAC, and regular container scans. At first they grumbled. A month later, they were grateful — because we caught vulnerabilities before they hit production.

## Lessons
- Security that gets in the way is ignored.  
- Default secure, then open up with intention.  
- Always assume the breach has already happened.  
- Every fix should leave behind a stronger process, not just a patch.
