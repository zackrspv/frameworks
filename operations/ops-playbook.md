# Operations Playbook
*Find the problem. Fix the problem. Don’t complicate it.*

Operations is where most orgs bleed out. Missed handoffs, broken processes, and duct-taped systems. Everyone complains, but nobody digs in. That’s where I come in.

## How I Approach Ops
1. **Listen First** – Frontline staff always know where the pain is. If tickets pile up in one spot, that’s your first clue.  
2. **Trace the Flow** – I follow the process end-to-end. Where does work slow down? Where do tools overlap? That’s usually where the real problem lives.  
3. **Cut the Noise** – A lot of “issues” are just bad habits or legacy steps nobody questioned. Kill what doesn’t add value.  
4. **Right-Size the Fix** – Don’t roll out a massive platform if training or a 2-line script solves it.  
5. **Lock It In** – Document the fix, assign ownership, and set a review cycle. If nobody owns it, it will rot.  

## Example
At CHR, ops felt like herding cats. Agents were juggling 5+ tools, none aligned. By auditing the flow, killing redundant systems, and consolidating into a lean stack, adoption jumped and costs dropped 42%. Not because of “new shiny tech,” but because we killed friction and gave people one way to work.

## Lessons
- Problems show up in frontline frustration. Listen.  
- Fix the system, not just the symptom.  
- Simpler processes stick. Complicated ones get ignored.  
- If nobody owns the fix, it’s not a fix.
