# Operations Playbook
*Right-sizing, automation, and simplification.*

## 🚩 The Problem
Operations bloat quietly. Processes pile up, tools overlap, nobody questions why steps exist. Suddenly “how we do things” is harder than the work itself.

## 🔧 Framework
1. **Map Workflows** – Write down every step. If you can’t explain it, kill it.  
2. **Remove First, Automate Later** – Don’t automate bad processes. Cut redundancy first.  
3. **Right-Size Tools** – Pick tools that match your scale, not some unicorn ideal.  
4. **Document & Train** – SOPs aren’t paperwork, they’re adoption glue.  
5. **Measure Continuously** – Cost, adoption, error rates.  

## 📈 Example
- CHR: Consolidated 15+ tools into 5 core systems → reduced costs 42%.  
- Compass Export Fix: Instead of brute-force job filtering, rethought the export pipeline to reduce complexity.  
- Tabulator Data Grids: Designed recalculation patterns that reflect frontend changes without blowing up performance.  

## 💡 Lessons
- Complexity is the enemy.  
- Ops strategy is about subtraction first, automation second.  
- Stable ops = scalable business.
