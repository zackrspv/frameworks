# GPU Infrastructure for AI Workloads

## 🏢 Context
Most startups jump into AI infra blind: they overspend on cloud GPUs, underestimate networking, or get locked into hyperscaler contracts. My approach has been battle-tested scaling clusters from single-GPU rigs → multi-node, multi-GPU clusters running real-time inference.

## 🔧 Principles
- **Right-size first** – Never start with H100s. Start with A6000s or A100s depending on workload.  
- **Mixed-use clusters** – Dedicate GPUs (1–2) for training, others for inference. Scale only when utilization hits 70%+.  
- **Scale stepwise** – 2 → 4 → 6 → 8 GPU clusters. Don't leapfrog ahead without profit margin to justify.  
- **Separate training vs. inference** – Long-term goal: clusters dedicated to each, but mixed until revenue allows.  

## 📈 Example
- 3× RTX A6000 cluster: 1 GPU dedicated to training, 2 to inference.  
- Scaled to 4× A6000: 2 training, 2 inference.  
- Medium-term: dual 4× A100 servers at $4,998/mo for faster fine-tuning.  
- Long-term: 3× 8× A6000 clusters, split between training + inference once profit margins justify.  

## 💡 Lessons
- Revenue before scale.  
- Profit margin dictates infra growth.  
- GPU scaling isn’t about raw power — it’s about balancing **speed, cost, and client deliverables**.
