# GPU Infrastructure for AI Workloads

## Context
Most startups burn cash on GPUs because they don’t know better. They jump to H100s on AWS, rack up insane bills, and then wonder why their margins suck. I’ve scaled clusters from single cards to multi-node rigs running real-time inference. Here’s what actually works.

## Principles
- Start with what fits your workload. You don’t need H100s out the gate. A6000s or A100s will get you far cheaper.  
- Mix usage until revenue justifies split clusters. One or two cards for training, the rest for inference.  
- Scale step by step. 2 GPUs, then 4, then 6, then 8. Don’t leap ahead unless profit margins cover it.  
- Long term, training and inference belong on separate clusters... but until you’ve got recurring revenue, keep it mixed.

## Example
- 3x RTX A6000 cluster. One GPU running training jobs. Two on inference.  
- At 4x GPUs, split it evenly: 2 training, 2 inference.  
- When profits cover it, add dual 4x A100 servers at ~$5K/month. Faster fine-tuning, way more efficient.  
- Long term target: three 8x A6000 clusters. Dedicated training on one side, inference on the other. Only when client revenue makes it worth it.

## Lessons
- Revenue comes before scale.  
- Margins decide infra growth, not hype.  
- Scaling GPUs isn’t about raw power. It’s about balancing speed, cost, and client deliverables.
