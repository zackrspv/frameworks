# Agentic Automation

## Problem

Most companies roll out “AI agents” like toys. Shiny demos, nothing in production, no guardrails. That’s not strategy. That’s theater.

## Framework

1. **Map workflows** – If you don’t know the process, you can’t automate it.
2. **Kill steps first** – If a step doesn’t need to exist, don’t automate it. Delete it.
3. **Pilot small** – Test with one team, one process. Measure.
4. **Layer governance** – Add approval flows where needed (finance, HR, legal).
5. **Scale smart** – Roll out only where it sticks, not everywhere at once.

## Example

* Automated client review reminders in zPortal: tied into CRM, pulled closing dates, sent review requests on schedule. Result: agent adoption went up, client reviews doubled, no one had to remember.
* Tried auto-summaries for deal notes, but killed it after testing because agents ignored them. Right call.

## Principle

Automation without governance is chaos. Automation without adoption is wasted effort.
