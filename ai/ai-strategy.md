# AI Strategy Framework
AI adoption isn’t about hype. It’s about ROI.

## Problem
Too many orgs chase headlines, spin up expensive GPU instances, or buy “AI in a box” without a plan. Result: wasted spend, no adoption, zero ROI.

## Framework
- Start with business outcomes: what revenue, savings, or risk reduction does this solve.
- Prove it small: prototype with one workflow before you scale anything.
- Right-size infra: don’t jump to H100s. Start with A6000s or A100s and expand only when utilization justifies it.
- Govern adoption: guardrails for compliance, data governance, and human-in-the-loop.
- Measure weekly: adoption, cost per inference, turnaround time. Kill what isn’t moving the needle.

## Example
- SoMee AI: 3× A6000 cluster powering real-time Spaces transcription plus RAG answers.
- CHR: AI-driven adoption reporting that pushed CRM usage to 90%+.
- ClusterX: 3× GPU clusters running fine-tuning and inference, with a roadmap to A100s at roughly $5K per month only after revenue covers a 2x–3x margin.

## Lessons
- Revenue before scale.
- AI is a tool, not a strategy.
- If you can’t prove ROI at small scale, scaling just burns cash faster.
