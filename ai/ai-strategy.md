# AI Strategy Framework
*AI adoption isn’t about hype — it’s about ROI.*

## 🚩 The Problem
Too many orgs chase AI headlines, spin up expensive GPU instances, or buy “AI in a box” SaaS without a plan. Result: wasted spend, no adoption, zero ROI.

## 🔧 Framework
1. **Start with Business Outcomes** – What revenue, savings, or risk reduction does this solve?  
2. **Prove on Small Scale** – Prototype with one workflow before scaling infra.  
3. **Right-Size Infra** – Don’t jump to H100s. Start with A6000s/A100s and expand only when utilization justifies.  
4. **Govern Adoption** – Guardrails for compliance, data governance, and human-in-the-loop.  
5. **Measure Weekly** – Adoption, cost per inference, turnaround time. Kill what isn’t moving the needle.  

## 📈 Example
- SoMee AI: 3× A6000 cluster powering real-time Spaces transcription + RAG answers.  
- CHR: AI-driven adoption reporting, boosting CRM usage to 90%+.  
- ClusterX: 3× GPU clusters running fine-tuning + inference, with a roadmap to A100s at $5K/mo only once revenue covered 2×–3× margin.

## 💡 Lessons
- Revenue before scale.  
- AI is a tool, not a strategy.  
- If you can’t prove ROI at small scale, scaling just burns cash faster.
