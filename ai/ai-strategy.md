# AI Strategy Framework
*AI adoption isn’t about hype. It’s about ROI.*

## The Problem
Too many orgs chase headlines. They buy “AI in a box” SaaS, spin up expensive cloud GPUs, or promise the board they’re building AGI. The result is burned budget, no adoption, and zero ROI.

## Framework
1. **Start with business outcomes**  
   What revenue, savings, or risk reduction does this solve? No outcome, no project.

2. **Prove on small scale**  
   Prototype one workflow before scaling. If it doesn’t show ROI, stop.

3. **Right-size infra**  
   Don’t start with H100s. Use A6000s or A100s. Expand only when utilization passes 70%.

4. **Govern adoption**  
   Compliance, data governance, and human-in-the-loop must be guardrails. AI without governance is chaos.

5. **Measure weekly**  
   Adoption, cost per inference, turnaround time. Kill anything that doesn’t move the needle.

## Example
- **SoMee AI**: 3× A6000 cluster running real-time Spaces transcription and RAG answers.  
- **CHR**: AI-driven adoption reporting that boosted CRM usage to 90%+.  
- **ClusterX**: 3 GPU clusters for fine-tuning + inference. Roadmap to A100s at $5K/month only when profit margin doubled.

## Lessons
Revenue before scale. AI is a tool, not a strategy. If you can’t prove ROI small, scaling only burns cash faster.
