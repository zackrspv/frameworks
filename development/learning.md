# Continuous Learning
*30 years in, still a student.*

## ðŸ“‚ My Practice
- Daily reading on AI infra, SaaS ecosystems, and emerging tools.  
- Experimenting with new frameworks (Alpine.js, Tabulator, RAGflow).  
- Treat client projects as learning labs â€” every consulting engagement leaves me sharper.  

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons
- Tech leaders who stop learning stop leading.  
- Curiosity compounds â€” your 1% daily growth stacks over decades.
