# Learning Framework

## Context
I’ve been in this game 25+ years. Tech moves fast. Tools, languages, frameworks — they all change. What doesn’t change is how you learn. Most people overcomplicate it or think they’re “done” once they get a title.

## My Approach
- **Stay Curious** – Ask why constantly. If something breaks, don’t just patch it. Understand it.
- **Hands-On First** – Reading helps, but nothing replaces breaking it in dev and fixing it yourself.
- **Teach to Learn** – If you can’t explain it to someone else (junior, peer, exec), you don’t really get it.
- **Stack Lessons** – Don’t chase every new shiny thing. Layer knowledge: fundamentals first, then apply to new tools.
- **Feedback Loops** – Whether it’s code reviews, ops postmortems, or just asking “what did I miss,” feedback locks in growth.

## Example
When I jumped from USAF comms systems into enterprise consulting, I didn’t know half the enterprise SaaS stack. Instead of pretending, I sat with the SMEs, asked questions, took notes, then wrote down my own distilled SOPs. Same thing with AI infra now — I didn’t just trust vendor docs, I ran clusters, broke them, tuned them, and wrote my own scaling rules.

## Lessons
- Learning is a habit, not an event.
- Curiosity beats credentials every time.
- The people who keep asking “why” are the ones still relevant a decade later.
