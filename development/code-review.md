# Code Review Framework
*Reviews should ship, not stall.*

## ðŸ”§ My Approach
- **Clarity > Cleverness** â€“ If itâ€™s too clever, Iâ€™ll ask for plain English.  
- **Edge-Case Hunter** â€“ I focus on what breaks, not nitpicks.  
- **Commit with the Team** â€“ Sometimes the fastest review is adding the fix myself.  
- **Collaborative** â€“ Explain fixes, donâ€™t just redline them.  

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons
- A code review isnâ€™t about ego â€” itâ€™s about shipping.  
- The best reviews leave devs sharper, not just corrected.
