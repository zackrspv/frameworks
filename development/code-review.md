# Code Review – My Style

Reviews are NOT about flexing. They’re about shipping.

- If your code is too “clever,” I’ll tell you to rewrite it in plain English. Future-you should understand it without a decoder ring.  
- I hunt edge cases — not to nitpick, but because that’s what breaks in prod.  
- Half my commits in private repos are “clarification commits.” If I can fix it faster myself, I will — and I’ll explain why.  
- Ego kills teams. Reviews are coaching, not a red pen.

👉 If your reviews don’t leave people sharper AND keep the release moving, you’re doing them wrong.
