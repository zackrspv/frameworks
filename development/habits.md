# Coding Habits
*Stay sharp, even when leadership eats your calendar.*

##  Context
As a technologist in leadership, most of my commits are reviews, fixes, or architecture notes. I don’t live in code 12 hours a day anymore, but I make damn sure I don’t lose touch with it.

## Habits
- **Read daily**  
  Even if I don’t write much, I read code every day. Pull requests, architecture diffs, bug fixes. Keeps my brain tuned.

- **Fix small things**  
  I’ll jump in for edge-case fixes, cleanup commits, or clarity refactors. These tiny commits show the team I still code and also keep me sharp.

- **Sandbox learning**  
  I use private repos to test new frameworks, not client codebases. Keeps experiments safe.

- **Context switching**  
  I document what I touch. Nothing worse than a leader who changes a line of code without leaving breadcrumbs.

- **Lead by example**  
  Code review is leadership. When I comment, I explain why—not just what.

##  Example
At CHR, I fixed serialization issues on an API integration nobody else wanted to touch. It wasn’t glamorous, but it unblocked a team and showed I was still in the game.

## Lessons
You don’t need to commit daily to stay sharp. You need discipline to keep reading, learning, and contributing in ways that move the team forward.
