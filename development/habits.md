# Development Habits
*Stay sharp, stay shipping.*

## ðŸ“‚ Notes
- Jumping between PHP, Python, and TypeScript keeps skills active.  
- I still write code, even in exec roles â€” credibility comes from being hands-on.  
- I learn new stacks (Alpine.js, Laravel 11+, AI pipelines) not because I need to, but because teams respect leaders who can.  

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons
- Stop coding and you stop leading effectively in tech.  
- Staying hands-on keeps strategy grounded.
